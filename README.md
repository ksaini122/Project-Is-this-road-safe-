Reasons for why we choose the SVM for this Data
SVM is usually used for two class or multiclass classification problems.
here we are using the popular iris dataset for predicrting  
for huge dataset we usually use DL but for small dataset such as iris itself we can use SVM ,
as it is the best general purpose algorithm for training such data sets
But there are some exception where SVM performs poorly for small datasets when the no. of features are much greater than the training examples.
Also SVM algorithm does not handle categorical features in special ways we either have to encode them using various encoders or we should use suitable algorithms such as catboost etc.
Iris dataset have numerical features which can be easily handeled by SVM.
